# ⚔️ Fetch Lab — Game of Thrones API

## 📖 Overview

This project demonstrates how to use the **`fetch()`** function in JavaScript to make web requests to an external API.  
The lab uses the **Game of Thrones API (An API of Ice and Fire)** to fetch and display a list of book titles.

## 🎯 Learning Goals

- Use `fetch()` to make API requests.
- Convert API responses from **JSON** into JavaScript objects.
- Display the data dynamically on a webpage using **DOM manipulation**.
- Understand how APIs expose data for developers.
- Write clean, testable JavaScript (return the fetch for CodeGrade).
